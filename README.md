# Reactive

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaGizmos/Reactive.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonniedie/Reactive.jl)


This is a fork of [Reactive.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Reactive.jl) for testing allocation-free reactive programming.


Reactive.jl is a package for reactive programming in Julia.

Reactive borrows its design from [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) (see [Functional Reactive Programming](http://elm-lang.org/learn/What-is-FRP.elm)).

## Quickstart

```{.julia execute="false"}
Pkg.add("Reactive")
using Reactive
```
